# Robotic arm - Pick & Place project
The goal of this project is to calculate the Inverse kinematics of Robotic arm to pick the object from the shelf and place it into the trash. see my `pdf` for extended details.

# Project Setup

If your gazebo version is not 7. 7.0+, perform the update as follows:
`$ gazebo --version`

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install gazebo7
```

If you do not have an active ROS workspace, you can create one by:
```sh
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/
$ catkin_make
```

Now that you have a workspace, clone or download this repo into the **src** directory of your workspace:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
$ git clone https://github.com/udacity/RoboND-Kinematics-Project.git
```

Now from a terminal window:

```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=kinetic -y
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/scripts
$ sudo chmod +x target_spawn.py
$ sudo chmod +x IK_server.py            
$ sudo chmod +x safe_spawner.sh
```
Build the project:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws
$ catkin_make
```

Add following to your .bashrc file
```
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/models

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

**For demo mode make sure the **demo** flag is set to _"true"_ in `inverse_kinematics.launch` file under /RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/launch**

In addition, you can also control the spawn location of the target object in the shelf. To do this, modify the **spawn_location** argument in `target_description.launch` file under /RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/launch. 0-9 are valid values for spawn_location with 0 being random mode.

You can launch the project by
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/scripts
$ ./safe_spawner.sh
```

If you are running in demo mode, this is all you need. To run your own Inverse Kinematics code change the **demo** flag described above to _"false"_ and run your code (once the project has successfully loaded) by:
```sh
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/scripts
$ rosrun kuka_arm IK_server.py
```
Once Gazebo and rviz are up and running, make sure you see following in the gazebo world:

	- Robot
	
	- Shelf
	
	- Blue cylindrical target in one of the shelves
	
	- Dropbox right next to the robot
	

If any of these items are missing, report as an issue.

Once all these items are confirmed, open rviz window, hit Next button.

To view the complete demo keep hitting Next after previous action is completed successfully.
